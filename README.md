# weather-dashboard

## Description

Weather dashoboard was created using JavScript, HTML, and CSS. The purpose of this app is to allow users to be able to search for any city and  view the current weather and the forecast for the next five days. The information regarding the weather was obtained from the [WEATHE-API-NAME-HERE] API by creating a fetch request. Afterwards the HTML was dynamically updated along with the CSS. Local storage and retrieving the weather icon were some of the issues that were encoutered while building this app. Although the issues were resolved by referencing countless number of articles it was still a challenge to overcome. In the future some helpful features that can be added are: allow the user to view previous weather data for comparison and allow the user to compare weather with different cities next to each other.
